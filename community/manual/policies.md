## Technical policies

### Technology Control Plan

Due to legal requirements of export control, members of CNERG must be familiar
with and formally agree to abide by the [Technology Control
Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jOE5C6Jz0MWhJqXuYs5KLFP5pjDyIbijcLWIsrRNTo0/edit).

### Data Management Plan

A [Data Management
Plan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19V0xBrmKNm65xoFOoCb_3zhGPtPTmk7vqeL809TV7tE)
helps to ensure  that researchers know were to find data and other digital
objects related to current or past projects.  This is also necessary to comply with
data management requirements of our sponsors.

### Author Style Guide

A consistent and professional style can both improve the readability and confer
a sense of authority to our publications and presentations.  This [style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11olSnxB78TBg0Tjns4JTMhzFB-jHXBfPPNoaRu-A4Zc/edit)
provides some guidance on establishing that consistent and professional style.

## Workplace policies


### Scheduling of Preliminary Exams and Defenses

To ensure appropriate time to review necessary documents, no prelim or defense
should be scheduled before a *complete draft* of the associated document has
been reviewed by the primary advisor.  In this context, a *complete draft* is a
version that includes all the results in some form, with a discussion of those
results.  It is **NOT** a final draft and may be subject to additional editing
by the author, advisor or others.  Rather, it should indicate that all results
have been collected and digested.

### Vacation and Personal Leave

Time away from work is an important part of maintaining [healthy work-life
balance](health_wellness.md), and all members of CNERG are encouraged to take
vacation.  Different employment categories have different formal policies for
the amount of leave that is available for employees, but the nature of research
combined with appointments that are formally part-time, can create confusion,
particularly with respect to vacation time.

Everyone is expected to consult their advisor/supervisor to discuss any
extended vacation or personal leave, to determine how it may interfere with
deadlines for their personal progress or for projects to which they are
contributing.
