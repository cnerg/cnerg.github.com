## Current Work

As the subject of his PhD dissertation, Connor is currently investigating the application of numerical optimization methods to stellarator fusion power plant design. This optimization methodology development focuses on the modification of plant breeding blanket and shielding systems and the corresponding effects on neutronics performance for a given stellarator magnetic configuration. This project leverages his previous work developing the open-source parametric modeling toolset [ParaStell](https://github.com/svalinn/parastell).
