Paul Wilson is the Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering and current
department chair of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)‘s
[Department of Nuclear Engineering & Engineering Physics](http://engineering.wisc.edu/neep). His research
interests focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of
complex nuclear energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding,
nuclear waste management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy. Paul
joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in August
2001 as part of the [Energy Systems and Policy Hiring
Initiative](https://facstaff.provost.wisc.edu/cluster-hiring-initiative/). 

In addition to the research pursued by his [Computational Nuclear Engineering
Research Group (CNERG)](http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu), Paul has served in a number
of advisory and consultant roles. From 2001-2003, he was a member of the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Generation IV Technology Roadmap Committee. In 2010, he
was engaged as a consultant to the CEA Saclay, ERC Petten, the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, and the [Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear
Energy
Future](http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf).
More recently he has been an advisor to [LastEnergy](https://www.lastenergy.com/) 
and served on the founding board of the 
[Good Energy Collective](https://www.goodenergycollective.org/).

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada,
Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of the [Engineering Science
program](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of
Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) in 1992. After receiving his Bachelor of
Applied Science in Engineering Science, he began his graduate schooling in
nuclear engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After three years,
he moved to Karlsruhe, Germany, where he studied in the Institute for Neutron
Physics and Reactor Engineering (of the [Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology](https://www.kit.edu)), earning his Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical
Engineering in 1998. Returning to Madison, Paul completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear
Engineering in 1999.

Paul has been active in the [American Nuclear Society](https://www.ans.org) for
over 30 years and was the founding president of the [North American Young
Generation in Nuclear [NA-YGN]](https://www.naygn.org). He represented the ANS
and NA-YGN at the [international climate change negotiations](http://unfccc.int)
in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1998), and Bonn, Germany (1999). He is also a member
of the Canadian Nuclear Society, the American Society for Engineering
Education, the Institute for Nuclear Materials Management, and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.

Paul is married and has two adult daughters. They enjoy biking around Madison’s paths,
floating on its lakes, eating at its restaurants, and enjoying its theaters.
