Paul Wilson is the Grainger Professor of Nuclear Engineering and current
department chair of the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.wisc.edu)‘s
[Department of Engineering Physics](http://www.engr.wisc.edu/ep). His research
interests focus on developing improved tools for computational modeling of
complex nuclear energy systems, with applications in radiation shielding,
nuclear waste management, nuclear non-proliferation and energy policy. Paul
joined the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in August
2001 as part of the [Energy Systems and Policy Hiring
Initiative](https://facstaff.provost.wisc.edu/cluster-hiring-initiative/). 

In addition to the research pursued by his [Computational Nuclear Engineering
Research Group (CNERG)](http://cnerg.engr.wisc.edu), Paul has served in a number
of advisory and consultant roles. From 2001-2003, he was a member of the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Generation IV Technology Roadmap Committee. In 2010, he
was engaged as a consultant to the CEA Saclay, ERC Petten, the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, and the [Blue Ribbon Commission on America’s Nuclear
Energy
Future](http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013/04/f0/brc_finalreport_jan2012.pdf).

Born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and raised in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada,
Paul specialized in the Nuclear Power option of the [Engineering Science
program](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the [University of
Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca). After receiving his Bachelor of Applied
Science in Engineering Science, he began his graduate schooling in nuclear
engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After three years, he moved
to Karlsruhe, Germany, where he studied in the Institute for Neutron Physics and
Reactor Engineering (of the [Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology](https://www.kit.edu)), earning his Dr.-Ing. degree in Mechanical
Engineering in 1998. Returning to Madison, Paul completed his Ph.D. in Nuclear
Engineering in 1999.

Paul was the founding President of the [North American Young Generation in
Nuclear [NA-YGN]](https://www.naygn.org), an organization created to provide
unique opportunities to young professionals in all fields of nuclear science &
technology. Paul has been active in the [American Nuclear Society](https://www.ans.org) for over 20
years, and currently serves on its Board of Directors. Paul also represented the
ANS and NA-YGN at the [international climate change negotiations](http://unfccc.int) in Buenos Aires,
Argentina (1998), and Bonn, Germany (1999). He is a member of the American and
Canadian Nuclear Societies, the American Society for Engineering Education and
the NA-YGN.

Paul is married and has two daughters. They enjoy biking around Madison’s paths
and spending time outside.
