Robert assists research efforts in the development of `Cyclus
<http://fuelcycle.org>`_, a nuclear fuel cycle simulation code. His research
interests revolve around comparative fuel cycle metrics and fuel cycle
optimization. He is concentrating on the development a framework for
large-scale optimization of fuel cycle transitions with particular interest on
disruption scenarios.

All that is fine and dandy, but really Robert likes to think of himself as a
(software) hacker.  And he also enjoys writing about himself in third person
voice.
