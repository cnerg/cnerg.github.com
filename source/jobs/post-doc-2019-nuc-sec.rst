Post-Doctoral Associate Opportunity (2019): Modeling, Simulation & Data Science for  Nuclear Non-proliferation
==============================================================================================================

*[Updated: December 1, 2019]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is participating
in a pair of new research consortium supported by the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation R&D Office of the NNSA.

Consortium for Enabling Technolog and Innovation
------------------------------------------------

CNERG is a leading participant in Data Science research thrust area of the
`Consortium for Enabling Technology and Innovation <http://eti.gatech.edu>`_
that will integrate cutting edge algorithms for machine learning
and data fusion with evolving data streams to enhance the ability to identify
misuse of nuclear materials and facilities.  The collaboration includes
researchers from the U. Wisconsin-Madison, U. Michigan, Duke, MIT, Texas A&M,
Georgia Tech, Washington State, & U. Hawaii, as well as a number of DOE
National Laboratories.  The four over-arching research areas within this
thrust are:
  * Framework for rapid evaluation of algorithms and data streams
  * Fundamental advances in data science algorithms
  * Machine-guided learning and data collection
  * Incorporation of novel data streams

CNERG researchers will lead the application of these technologies to problems
relevant to the nuclear non-proliferation mission, with a particular focus on
the development of the integrating framework.

Consortium for Monitoring, Technology and Verification
------------------------------------------------------

CNERG is also a participant in the Signals and Source Terms research thrust
area of the `Consortium for Monitoring, Technology and Verification
<http://mtv.engin.umich.edu>`_ that will provide insight into the set of
measurable quantities at various stages in the processing and handling of
nuclear materials.

CNERG researchers develop computational models of nuclear facilities with
sufficient fidelity to simulate the time-varying nature of such measurable
quantities as those facilities engage in normal and off-normal activities.

Post-doctoral Activities
------------------------

CNERG is seeking a qualified individual(s) to:
  * assist in the application of modern data analytics algorithms to nuclear
    non-proliferation data sets, through the development of a framework that
    integrates both new and existing algorithms and data streams, and/or
  * provide leadership in the development and validation of such computational
    models.  Working in collaboration with other consortium partners, the
    primary measurables of interest will be identified and the models will be
    improved to increase the reliability of simulating those measurable
    quantities.

Degree and area of specialization
----------------------------------

* PhD in Computer Science, Nuclear Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Industrial
  Engineering, Physics, or related field

Required experience
---------------------


* Demonstrated experience with development and testing of
    * machine learning and/or data fusion algorithms and/or
    * software models for nuclear systems, particularly in the areas of
      radiation transport and nuclide inventory tracking

* Some experience with components of a modern team-based software development processes:

    * version control (e.g. git)
    * bug/issue tracking (e.g. github)
    * test driven development (e.g. google test and pytest)
    * automatic documentation (e.g. doxygen and sphinx)
    * build & configuration management (e.g. cmake, make)

* Strong oral and written communication skills

Desired Experience
------------------

* Demonstrated experience with the application of machine learning and/or data
  fusion algorithms to real-world problems
* Experience working across disciplinary boundaries for the application of
  data analytics algorithms
* Familiarity with monitoring and safeguards of nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Experience with nuclear fuel cycle simulation
* Experience with contemporary machine learning and/or data fusion algorithms
* Experience with C++ and/or python programming languages

Specific Duties
---------------

* Identify and implement algorithms for use in nuclear non-proliferation
  applications, or surrogate applications as defined by consortium partners
* Develop systems for integration of various data streams and various algorithms
  to support real-world applications of algorithms     
* Identify safeguards and monitoring approaches for nuclear fuel cycle facilities
* Develop and improve nuclear fuel cycle facility models to support simulation
  of those safeguards and monitoring approaches
* Mentor and advise graduate student and undergraduate researchers
* Collaborate with multiple research groups across consortium    
* Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
