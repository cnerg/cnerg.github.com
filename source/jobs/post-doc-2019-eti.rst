Post-Doctoral Associate Opportunity (2019): Data Science for Nuclear Non-Proliferation
=======================================================================================

*[Updated: March 27, 2019]*

The Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group (CNERG) is a leading
participant in Data Science research thrust area of the `Consortium for
Enabling Technology and Innovation <http://eti.gatech.edu>`_.  This thrust
area will integrate cutting edge algorithms for machine learning and data
fusion with evolving data streams to enhance the ability to identify misuse of
nuclear materials and facilities.  The collaboration includes researchers from
the U. Wisconsin-Madison, U. Michigan, Duke, MIT, Texas A&M, Georgia Tech,
Washington State, & U. Hawaii, as well as a number of DOE National
Laboratories.  The four over-arching research areas within this thrust are:
  * Framework for rapid evaluation of algorithms and data streams
  * Fundamental advances in data science algorithms
  * Machine-guided learning and data collection
  * Incorporation of novel data streams

CNERG researchers will lead the application of these technologies to problems
relevant to the nuclear non-proliferation mission, with a particular focus on
the development of the integrating framework.
    
CNERG is seeking a qualified individual to assist in the application of modern
data analytics algorithms to nuclear non-proliferation data sets, through the
development of a framework that integrates both new and existing algorithms
and data streams.

Degree and area of specialization
----------------------------------

* PhD in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Statistics, Industrial
  Engineering, Nuclear Engineering or related field

Required experience
---------------------

* Demonstrated experience with development and testing of machine learning
  and/or data fusion algorithms

* Some experience with components of a modern team-based software development processes:

    * version control (e.g. git)
    * bug/issue tracking (e.g. github)
    * test driven development (e.g. google test and pytest)
    * automatic documentation (e.g. doxygen and sphinx)
    * build & configuration management (e.g. cmake, make)

* Strong oral and written communication skills

Desired Experience
------------------

* Demonstrated experience with the application of machine learning and/or data
  fusion algorithms to real-world problems
* Experience working across disciplinary boundaries for the application of
  data analytics algorithms

Specific Duties
---------------

* Identify and implement algorithms for use in nuclear non-proliferation
  applications, or surrogate applications as defined by consortium partners
* Develop systems for integration of various data streams and various algorithms
  to support real-world applications of algorithms     
* Mentor and advise graduate student and undergraduate researchers
* Collaborate with multiple research groups across consortium    
* Author publications for refereed journals and important conference proceedings
