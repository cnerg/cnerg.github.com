  abstract: "Recent growth in computing now permits large-scale multiphysics modeling using Monte Carlo methods,
considered state-of-the-art for particle transport. The Monte Carlo method is well-suited for
benchmarking lower-fidelity tools, guiding multigroup cross section library development, and aspects of
reactor design. However, Monte Carlo methods remain expensive, especially in multiphysics workflows
where simulations are performed iteratively. Significant expertise is also needed to pre-divide phase
space for scoring tallies, taking into account competing effects including spatial detail, runtime, memory
usage, and propagation of truncation/statistical errors to coupled physics solvers. Adaptive mesh
refinement (AMR) is a technique which adaptively refines (or coarsens) a mesh to preferentially add
Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) where the error is highest, and remove DOFs where the solution is already
well-captured. Despite the remarkable success of AMR in other fields, there has been very limited use of
AMR for Monte Carlo tally meshes, especially in the context of multiphysics or in combination with hand p-refinement. This proposal will develop the fundamental methods and techniques for
unstructured mesh AMR with Monte Carlo tallies to enable a transformative leap forward in
speed, accuracy, and robustness of Monte Carlo methods for advanced simulation."
