Concurrently, pseudo Monte Carlo methods have become prevalent in rendering applications to support more realistic models for scattering media, motivating innovations that are advantageous for MCRT simulations. The authors’ work extends these innovations by employing Intel’s Embree ray tracing kernel within a geometry toolkit for Monte Carlo to improve the simulation performance using CAD-based models by factors of 1.5 to 2.",

This development was initiated as part of efforts to evaluate recent data acquired during an experimental campaign conducted at UWNR to generate benchmark data for validation. Specifically, this evaluation effort aims to contribute a number of fresh and depleted critical (CRIT) configurations of UWNR as well as steady-state and transient reaction-rate (RRATE) measurements. Previous efforts led to a scripted UWNR model that supports automated generation of inputs for MCNP and Serpent. Recently, this capability was extended to SCALE/KENO, which required significant changes to the underlying geometry and material representations. All three Monte Carlo tools (MCNP, Serpent, and KENO) are being used to evaluate a variety of zero-power, fresh-critical configuration and will be used to model burnup for evaluation of depleted-critical configurations. The inclusion of SCALE/KENO input generation makes possible a variety of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses using the TSUNAMI and SAMPLER modules of SCALE. In addition, an automated mesh-generation option was added based on the UW-developed, MCNP-to-CAD plugin. As a result, a meshed geometry for use with deterministic tools (e.g., MAMMOTH/Rattlesnake) can be produced that is fully consistent with the Monte Carlo models. Work is ongoing to develop a full core model in MAMMOTH/Rattlesnake, which is a deterministic code based on the MOOSE framework. This model will be used for the evaluation of several transient experiments conducted at UWNR. Preliminary results of fresh-critical configurations show a good agreement among the four codes and experimental data. Also, preliminary results of depleted-critical configurations indicate that the depleted core model successfully tracks core reactivity over time as long as an initial (but relatively small) reactivity bias is eliminated. Formal uncertainty quantification will be carried out using SCALE to study the impact of model uncertainties on the effective multiplication factor and other observables. In conclusion, the evaluation of UWNR benchmark data provides increased confidence in various states/configurations of the UWNR computational model and will provide a unique model for use by other analysts.},\n\tbooktitle = {Proceedings of the {PHYSOR} 2020},\n\tauthor = {Park, YoungHui and Cheng, Ye and Elzohery, Rabab and Wilson, Paul P.H. and Roberts, Jeremy A. and DeHart, Mark D.},\n\tmonth = apr,\n\tyear = {2020},\n\tpages = {10},\n}\n",

Liquid metal behavior, solid substrate aspects, and fusion facility integration aspects are examined, with concepts as the research focusing element.

Transforming these concepts into viable technologies will require considerable research and development. With the fusion nuclear regime in mind, the Fusion Energy System Studies group examined LM PFCs in order to identify needed research thrusts that could accelerate their development and assess their viability. Liquid metal behavior, solid substrate aspects, and fusion facility integration aspects are examined, with concepts as the research focusing element. The concepts applied to a fusion nuclear device are the primary definer of the LM parameters, environmental conditions, and operational aspects.

Des. 82 590) has been engaged in a multi-campaign effort, including experiments in D, H and T, leading up to 2020 and the first experiments with 50\\%/50\\% D–T mixtures since 1997 and the first ever D–T plasmas with the ITER mix of plasma-facing component materials. For this purpose, a concerted physics and technology programme was launched with a view to prepare the D–T campaign (DTE2). This paper addresses the key elements developed by the JET programme directly contributing to the D–T preparation. This intense preparation includes the review of the physics basis for the D–T operational scenarios, including the fusion power predictions through first principle and integrated modelling, and the impact of isotopes in the operation and physics of D–T plasmas (thermal and particle transport, high confinement mode (H-mode) access, Be and W erosion, fuel recovery, etc). This effort also requires improving several aspects of plasma operation for DTE2, such as real time control schemes, heat load control, disruption avoidance and a mitigation system (including the installation of a new shattered pellet injector), novel ion cyclotron resonance heating schemes (such as the three-ions scheme), new diagnostics (neutron camera and spectrometer, active Alfvèn eigenmode antennas, neutral gauges, radiation hard imaging systems…) and the calibration of the JET neutron diagnostics at 14 MeV for accurate fusion power measurement. The active preparation of JET for the 2020 D–T campaign provides an incomparable source of information and a basis for the future D–T operation of ITER, and it is also foreseen that a large number of key physics issues will be addressed in support of burning plasmas.},\n\tlanguage = {en},\n\tnumber = {11},\n\turldate = {2020-05-01},\n\tjournal = {Nuclear Fusion},\n\tauthor = {Joffrin, E. and Abduallev, S. and Abhangi, M. and Abreu, P. and Afanasev, V. and Afzal, M. and Aggarwal, K.

            "abstractNote": "For the past several years, the JET scientific programme (Pamela et al 2007 Fusion Eng. Des. 82 590) has been engaged in a multi-campaign effort, including experiments in D, H and T, leading up to 2020 and the first experiments with 50%/50% D–T mixtures since 1997 and the first ever D–T plasmas with the ITER mix of plasma-facing component materials. For this purpose, a concerted physics and technology programme was launched with a view to prepare the D–T campaign (DTE2). This paper addresses the key elements developed by the JET programme directly contributing to the D–T preparation. This intense preparation includes the review of the physics basis for the D–T operational scenarios, including the fusion power predictions through first principle and integrated modelling, and the impact of isotopes in the operation and physics of D–T plasmas (thermal and particle transport, high confinement mode (H-mode) access, Be and W erosion, fuel recovery, etc). This effort also requires improving several aspects of plasma operation for DTE2, such as real time control schemes, heat load control, disruption avoidance and a mitigation system (including the installation of a new shattered pellet injector), novel ion cyclotron resonance heating schemes (such as the three-ions scheme), new diagnostics (neutron camera and spectrometer, active Alfvèn eigenmode antennas, neutral gauges, radiation hard imaging systems…) and the calibration of the JET neutron diagnostics at 14 MeV for accurate fusion power measurement. The active preparation of JET for the 2020 D–T campaign provides an incomparable source of information and a basis for the future D–T operation of ITER, and it is also foreseen that a large number of key physics issues will be addressed in support of burning plasmas.",

The primary aim of this work was to compare kerma measurements with advanced Monte Carlo code calculations of nuclear heating. Wall thickness, collection gap and fill gas pressure were chosen to satisfy Bragg-Gray criteria, so that measured ionization current was related to the kerma rate in the wall material. Chamber wall materials comprised of low mass number elements, including hydrogen-rich C552 air-equivalent plastic and beryllium, were selected to measure the kerma due to fast neutron elastic scattering. By operating these neutron sensitive chambers coincidentally with relatively neutron insensitive chambers composed of aluminum and Zircaloy-4, we were able to measure the total heating due to fast neutrons and gamma rays in a material, and differentiate these heating components. A chamber comprised of borated stainless steel was used in a similar fashion to measure thermal neutron flux. The total kerma rate was also measured in various materials typically found in a reactor core. Chamber collection volumes were initially determined using ambient air fill gas and NIST-traceable air-kerma rates from a 60Co source. All chambers were sealed with argon gas to provide thermal and compositional stability. Chamber properties, including stability, saturation and gas phase mass subject to charge collection, were determined using the 60Co source. Chambers were operated for approximately 30 minutes adjacent the reactor core, and integrity of gas seals was subsequently verified by repeating the measurement with the 60Co source.},\n\tjournal = {IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science},\n\tauthor = {Radtke, Jeff and Deluca, Paul and Anderson, Dan and Wilson, Paul and Bartol, Laura and Maile, Andrew and Agasie, Robert and Trumbull, Timothy and Grant, Edwin and Brooks, Paul and Anderson, Mark and Culberson, Wesley},\n\tyear = {2019},\n\tkeywords = {Bragg-Gray, Kerma, TRIGA, ionization chamber, neutron-gamma discrimination, nuclear heating},\n\tpages = {2160--2169},\n}\n",

State-of-the-art modeling/analysis tools facilitated a full 3-D neutronics analysis of the latest FESS-FNSF design. The first stage of the analysis involved the selection of materials for the first wall and blanket along with shielding materials to protect the magnet based on extensive 1-D analyses. The second stage is a stepwise workflow to estimate the overall tritium breeding ratio with high fidelity. It involved a bottom-up approach by coupling the CAD model with the 3-D MCNP code using DAGMC and adding the relevant design details in steps to assess the effect of such details on the tritium breeding ratio. The final stage involved calculations of the values of damage parameters at specific components: the first wall, the vacuum vessel, and magnet.},\n\tnumber = {3},\n\turldate = {2019-10-09},\n\tjournal = {Fusion Science and Technology},\n\tauthor = {Harb, M. and El-Guebaly, L. and Davis, A. and Wilson, P. and Marriott, E. and Benzaquen, J. and Team, FESS-FNSF},\n\tmonth = oct,\n\tyear = {2017},\n\tkeywords = {DAGMC, FESS-FNSF, radiation damage, tritium breeding ratio},\n\tpages = {510--515},\n}\n",

State-of-the-art modeling/analysis tools facilitated a full 3-D neutronics analysis of the latest FESS-FNSF design. The first stage of the analysis involved the selection of materials for the first wall and blanket along with shielding materials to protect the magnet based on extensive 1-D analyses. The second stage is a stepwise workflow to estimate the overall tritium breeding ratio with high fidelity. It involved a bottom-up approach by coupling the CAD model with the 3-D MCNP code using DAGMC and adding the relevant design details in steps to assess the effect of such details on the tritium breeding ratio. The final stage involved calculations of the values of damage parameters at specific components: the first wall, the vacuum vessel, and magnet.",

This first step is considered mandatory to establish the materials and component database in the real fusion in-service environment before proceeding to larger electricity producing facilities. The FNSF can be shown to make tremendous advances beyond ITER, toward a power plant, particularly in plasma duration and fusion nuclear environment. A moderate FNSF is studied in detail, which does not generate net electricity, but does reach the power plant blanket operating temperatures. The full poloidal Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) blanket is chosen, with alternates being the Helium Cooled Lead Lithium (HCLL) and Helium Cooled Ceramic Breeder/Pebble Bed (HCCB/PB). Several power plant relevant choices are made in order to follow the philosophy of targeted technologies. Any fusion core component must be qualified by fusion relevant neutron testing and highly integrated non-nuclear testing before it can be installed on the FNSF in order to avoid the high probability of constant failures in a plasma-vacuum system. A range of missions for the FNSF, or any fusion nuclear facility on the path toward fusion power plants, are established and characterized by several metrics. A conservative physics strategy is pursued to accommodate the transition to ultra-long plasma pulses, and parameters are chosen to represent the power plant regime to the extent possible. An operating space is identified, and from this, one point is chosen for further detailed analysis, with R = 4.8 m, a = 1.2 m, IP = 7.9 MA, BT = 7.5 T, βN \\&lt; 2.7, n/nGr = 0.9, fBS = 0.52, q95 = 6.0, H98 ∼1.0, and Q = 4.0. The operating space is shown to be robust to parameter variations. A program is established for the FNSF to show how the missions for the facility are met, with a He/H, a DD and 5 DT phases. The facility requires ∼25 years to complete its DT operation, including 7.8 years of neutron production, and the remaining spent on inspections and maintenance. The DD phase is critical to establish the ultra-long plasma pulse lengths. The blanket testing strategy is examined, and shows that many sectors have penetrations for heating and current drive (H/CD), diagnostics, or Test Blanket Modules (TBMs). The hot cell is a critical facility element in order for the FNSF to perform its function of developing the in-service material and component database. The pre-FNSF R\\&amp;D is laid out in terms of priority topics, with the FNSF phases driving the time-lines for R\\&amp;D completion. A series of detailed technical assessments of the FNSF operating point are reported in this issue, showing the credibility of such a step, and more detailed emphasis on R\\&amp;D items to pursue. These include nuclear analysis, thermo-mechanics and thermal-hydraulics, liquid metal thermal hydraulics, transient thermo-mechanics, tritium analysis, maintenance assessment, magnet specification and analysis, materials assessments, core and scrape-off layer (SOL)/divertor plasma examinations.},\n\tjournal = {Fusion Engineering and Design},\n\tauthor = {Kessel, C.

Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (MC)/deterministic techniques are necessary for this analysis because FES are large, heavily\nshielded, and contain streaming paths that can only be resolved with MC. The tremendous complexity of\nFES necessitates the use of CAD geometry for design and analysis. Previous ITER analysis has required\nthe translation of CAD geometry to MCNP5 form in order to use the AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion\nGenerator (ADVANTG) for hybrid MC/deterministic transport. In this work, ADVANTG was modified\nto support CAD geometry, allowing hybrid (MC)/deterministic transport to be done automatically and\neliminating the need for this translation step.

            "abstractNote": "Detailed radiation transport calculations are necessary for many aspects of the design of fusion\nenergy systems (FES) such as ensuring occupational safety, assessing the activation of system components\nfor waste disposal, and maintaining cryogenic temperatures within superconducting magnets. Hybrid\nMonte Carlo (MC)/deterministic techniques are necessary for this analysis because FES are large, heavily\nshielded, and contain streaming paths that can only be resolved with MC. The tremendous complexity of\nFES necessitates the use of CAD geometry for design and analysis. Previous ITER analysis has required\nthe translation of CAD geometry to MCNP5 form in order to use the AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion\nGenerator (ADVANTG) for hybrid MC/deterministic transport. In this work, ADVANTG was modified\nto support CAD geometry, allowing hybrid (MC)/deterministic transport to be done automatically and\neliminating the need for this translation step. This was done by adding a new ray tracing routine\nto ADVANTG for CAD geometries using the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC)\nsoftware library. This new capability is demonstrated with a prompt dose rate calculation for an ITER\ncomputational benchmark problem using both the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling\n(CADIS) method an the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method.

As a part of the BM design process, nuclear analysis is required to determine the level of nuclear heating, helium production, and radiation damage in the BM. Additionally, nuclear heating in the VV is also important for assessing the BM design. We used the CAD based DAG-MCNP5 transport code to analyze detailed models inserted into a 40-degree partially homogenized ITER global model. The regions analyzed include BM01, the neutral beam injection (NB) region, and the upper port region. For BM01, the results show that He production meets the limit necessary for re-welding, and the VV heating behind BM01 is acceptable. For the NBI region, the VV nuclear heating behind the NB region exceeds the design limit by a factor of two. For the upper port region, the nuclear heating of the VV exceeds the design limit by up to 20\\%. The results presented in this work are being used to modify the BM design in the cases where limits are exceeded.},\n\tnumber = {9–10},\n\turldate = {2014-08-08},\n\tjournal = {Fusion Engineering and Design},\n\tauthor = {Bohm, T.

            "abstractNote": "In ITER, the blanket modules (BM) are arranged around the plasma to provide thermal and nuclear shielding for the vacuum vessel (VV), magnets, and other components. As a part of the BM design process, nuclear analysis is required to determine the level of nuclear heating, helium production, and radiation damage in the BM. Additionally, nuclear heating in the VV is also important for assessing the BM design. We used the CAD based DAG-MCNP5 transport code to analyze detailed models inserted into a 40-degree partially homogenized ITER global model. The regions analyzed include BM01, the neutral beam injection (NB) region, and the upper port region. For BM01, the results show that He production meets the limit necessary for re-welding, and the VV heating behind BM01 is acceptable. For the NBI region, the VV nuclear heating behind the NB region exceeds the design limit by a factor of two. For the upper port region, the nuclear heating of the VV exceeds the design limit by up to 20%. The results presented in this work are being used to modify the BM design in the cases where limits are exceeded.",

Processes and parameters found to influence repository perfor- mance include the rate of waste form degradation, timing of waste package failure, and various coupled geochemical and hydrologic characteristics of the natural system including dif- fusion, solubility, and advection.",

These coils are located on the outboard side of ITER between the shield modules and vacuum vessel (VV) and are subject to high radiation levels. Detailed three-dimensional (3-D) models of the toroidal and poloidal legs of the ELM coil and surrounding region for the MCNP code were updated to reflect the latest design changes. Neutronics calculations were performed to determine a variety of radiation damage parameters for the ELM coils as well as the VV located behind them. Additionally, detailed CAD based models for the upper ELM coil region were used to perform a CAD based analysis using the DAG-MCNP5 code. The results show that the ELM coil will meet the specified material radiation limits. However, the nuclear heating on the vacuum vessel behind the poloidal multi-pipe manifolds will exceed the specified limit.},\n\tjournal = {Fusion Engineering and Design},\n\tauthor = {Bohm, T.D. and Sawan, M.E. and Jackson, S.T. and Wilson, P.P.H.},\n\tmonth = feb,\n\tyear = {2012},\n\tkeywords = {CAD, CAD, Coils, Edge Localized Modes, International Thermonuclear Reactor (ITER), MCNP, MCNP, Neutronics, Neutronics},\n}\n",

These coils are located on the outboard side of ITER between the shield modules and vacuum vessel (VV) and are subject to high radiation levels. Detailed three-dimensional (3-D) models of the toroidal and poloidal legs of the ELM coil and surrounding region for the MCNP code were updated to reflect the latest design changes. Neutronics calculations were performed to determine a variety of radiation damage parameters for the ELM coils as well as the VV located behind them. Additionally, detailed CAD based models for the upper ELM coil region were used to perform a CAD based analysis using the DAG-MCNP5 code. The results show that the ELM coil will meet the specified material radiation limits. However, the nuclear heating on the vacuum vessel behind the poloidal multi-pipe manifolds will exceed the specified limit.",

Two blanket concepts were considered; Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL), and Helium Cooled Ceramic Breeder (HCCB). A peak outboard neutron wall loading of 2 MW/m2 and a fluence of 6 MW-yr/m2 can be achieved with 240 MW fusion power. The tritium breeding ratio is adequate for both blankets. Modest magnet damage parameters were obtained. However, it is recommended that the PF coil in the divertor region be moved vertically farther from the mid-plane to allow adding ~15 cm of shield to reduce the peak organic insulator dose to an acceptable level.",

By employing a number of acceleration techniques, the ray-tracing operations that are fundamental to Monte Carlo radiation transport are implemented efficiently for direct use on the CAD-based solid model, eliminating the need to translate to the native Monte Carlo input language. By forming hierarchical trees of oriented bounding boxes, one for each facet that results from a high-fidelity tessellation of the model, the ray-tracing performance is adequate to permit detailed analysis of large complex systems. In addition to the reduction in human effort and improvement in quality assurance that is found in the translation approaches, the DAGMC approach also permits the analysis of geometries with higher order surfaces that cannot be represented by many native Monte Carlo radiation transport tools. The paper describes the various acceleration techniques and demonstrates the resulting capability in a real fusion neutronics analysis.},\n\tnumber = {10-12},\n\tjournal = {Fusion Engineering and Design},\n\tauthor = {Wilson, P.P.H. and Tautges, T.J. and Kraftcheck, J.A. and Smith, B.M. and Henderson, D.L.},\n\tyear = {2010},\n\tkeywords = {Acceleration, CAD, DAGMC, Fusion, Geometry, Monte Carlo Methods, Neutronics, Software Development},\n\tpages = {1759--1765},\n}\n",

            "abstractNote": "The Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) software library offers a unique approach to performing neutronics analysis on CAD-based geometries of fusion systems. By employing a number of acceleration techniques, the ray-tracing operations that are fundamental to Monte Carlo radiation transport are implemented efficiently for direct use on the CAD-based solid model, eliminating the need to translate to the native Monte Carlo input language. By forming hierarchical trees of oriented bounding boxes, one for each facet that results from a high-fidelity tessellation of the model, the ray-tracing performance is adequate to permit detailed analysis of large complex systems. In addition to the reduction in human effort and improvement in quality assurance that is found in the translation approaches, the DAGMC approach also permits the analysis of geometries with higher order surfaces that cannot be represented by many native Monte Carlo radiation transport tools. The paper describes the various acceleration techniques and demonstrates the resulting capability in a real fusion neutronics analysis.",

            "abstractNote": "An extensive benchmark exercise has been conducted on ITER with the objective to test and validate different approaches for the use of CAD generated geometry data for Monte Carlo transport calculations with the MCNP code. The exercise encompassed the generation of a dedicated neutronics CATIA model based on available engineering CAD design data, the conversion into MCNP geometry, the verification of the converted models, and a number of calculations to compare the different approaches with regard to the performance and the validity of the results obtained. The paper briefly reviews the different approaches and provides a detailed description of the ITER benchmark effort, its results and conclusions showing that the approaches have reached the maturity level to allow their application to real ITER design analyses. This is considered an essential step forward for neutronics analysis tools to satisfy ITER quality assurance rules.",
