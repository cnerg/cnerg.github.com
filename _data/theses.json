The SDR can be calculated using the Rigorous Two-Step (R2S) method, which requires a separate neutron and photon transport calculations coupled with an activation calculation. The current R2S workflow for accelerator-driven system relies on physics models in the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code to simulate interactions beyond the nuclear data libraries' energy domain.

Labeling sufficient volumes of radiation data for\nsuccessful supervised machine learning can be too costly when manual analysis is employed.\nTherefore, this work is developing a machine learning model built on semi-supervised learning\nto utilize both labeled and unlabeled data and therefore alleviate the cost of labeling.\nAs a preliminary experiment, radiation measurements collected with sodium iodide (NaI)\ndetectors from the Multi-Informatics for Nuclear Operating Scenarios (MINOS) testbed at\nOak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) are used. Anomalous measurements are identified\nusing a method of statistical hypothesis testing. After background estimation, an energy\ndependent spectroscopic analysis is used to characterize an anomaly based on its radiation\nsignatures in a noisy labeling heuristic. These noisily labeled spectra are used in training and\ntesting classification models that estimate a binary label: SNM transfer or other anomalous\nmeasurement. Supervised logistic regression—trained only on limited labeled data—serves\nas a baseline to compare three semi-supervised machine learning models all trained on the\nsame limited labeled data and a larger volume of unlabeled data: co-training, Label Propagation, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In each case, the semi-supervised models\noutperform logistic regression, suggesting unlabeled data can be valuable when training and\ndemonstrating performative value in semi-supervised nonproliferation implementations.\nThis work uses a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to efficiently extract\ninformation from unlabeled data. A contrastive model learns patterns by perturbing data\ninstances using a set of label-invariant data augmentations, meaning augmented samples\npreserve labeling information present in an original measurement. A set of transformations\nare designed for gamma spectra, tailored for specific principles of radiation detection. MINOS\nmeasurements are augmented, and an encoder is contrastively trained to produce meaningful\nhigh-dimensional representations of spectra. A supervised classifier then uses these encoded\nrepresentations to assign a label estimating whether a given transfer spectrum was of tracked\nnuclear material or not. Even a simple linear model built on these representations and trained\non limited labeled data can achieve a balanced accuracy score of 80.30\\%.\nSeveral tools are employed for evaluating the efficacy of augmentations, representations,\nand classification models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to demonstrate\nthat representations provide a richer feature space for detecting nuclear material transfers\nby embedding distributional information from unlabeled data. Integrated Gradients connect a classifier’s decision boundary to spectral features, suggesting the framework learns\nrelevant patterns in spectra that can be used for detecting transfers. When labeled data\nare scarce, this work suggests that training a supervised classifier should be prioritized over\nsemi-supervised (compared to self-supervised) contrastive learning an encoder to maximize\ndetection accuracy. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted, finding a locally optimum\nmaximum cross-validated balanced accuracy score. Overall, a methodology has been established for using semi-supervision to accurately classify SNM transfers without the prohibitive\ncost of labeling.},\n\turldate = {2024-03-18},\n\tschool = {University of Wisconsin-Madison},\n\tauthor = {Stomps, Jordan},\n\tyear = {2023},\n}\n",

After background estimation, an energy\ndependent spectroscopic analysis is used to characterize an anomaly based on its radiation\nsignatures in a noisy labeling heuristic. These noisily labeled spectra are used in training and\ntesting classification models that estimate a binary label: SNM transfer or other anomalous\nmeasurement. Supervised logistic regression—trained only on limited labeled data—serves\nas a baseline to compare three semi-supervised machine learning models all trained on the\nsame limited labeled data and a larger volume of unlabeled data: co-training, Label Propagation, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In each case, the semi-supervised models\noutperform logistic regression, suggesting unlabeled data can be valuable when training and\ndemonstrating performative value in semi-supervised nonproliferation implementations.\nThis work uses a self-supervised contrastive learning framework to efficiently extract\ninformation from unlabeled data. A contrastive model learns patterns by perturbing data\ninstances using a set of label-invariant data augmentations, meaning augmented samples\npreserve labeling information present in an original measurement. A set of transformations\nare designed for gamma spectra, tailored for specific principles of radiation detection. MINOS\nmeasurements are augmented, and an encoder is contrastively trained to produce meaningful\nhigh-dimensional representations of spectra. A supervised classifier then uses these encoded\nrepresentations to assign a label estimating whether a given transfer spectrum was of tracked\nnuclear material or not. Even a simple linear model built on these representations and trained\non limited labeled data can achieve a balanced accuracy score of 80.30%.\nSeveral tools are employed for evaluating the efficacy of augmentations, representations,\nand classification models. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to demonstrate\nthat representations provide a richer feature space for detecting nuclear material transfers\nby embedding distributional information from unlabeled data. Integrated Gradients connect a classifier’s decision boundary to spectral features, suggesting the framework learns\nrelevant patterns in spectra that can be used for detecting transfers. When labeled data\nare scarce, this work suggests that training a supervised classifier should be prioritized over\nsemi-supervised (compared to self-supervised) contrastive learning an encoder to maximize\ndetection accuracy. Hyperparameter optimization was conducted, finding a locally optimum\nmaximum cross-validated balanced accuracy score. Overall, a methodology has been established for using semi-supervision to accurately classify SNM transfers without the prohibitive\ncost of labeling.",

Improvement and research is needed for technical components of this process. One such area is the provenance of non-detonated special nuclear material; studied here is spent nuclear fuel (SNF), which is applicable in a scenario involving the unlawful use of commercial byproducts from nuclear power reactors. The experimental process involves measuring known forensics signatures to ascertain the reactor parameters that produced the material, assisting in locating its source. This work proposes the use of statistical methods to determine these quantities instead of empirical relationships.\nThe purpose of this work is to probe the feasibility of this method with a focus on field-deployable detection.

            "abstractNote": "Nuclear forensics is a nuclear security capability that is broadly defined as material attribution in the event of a nuclear incident. Improvement and research is needed for technical components of this process. One such area is the provenance of non-detonated special nuclear material; studied here is spent nuclear fuel (SNF), which is applicable in a scenario involving the unlawful use of commercial byproducts from nuclear power reactors. The experimental process involves measuring known forensics signatures to ascertain the reactor parameters that produced the material, assisting in locating its source. This work proposes the use of statistical methods to determine these quantities instead of empirical relationships.\nThe purpose of this work is to probe the feasibility of this method with a focus on field-deployable detection. Thus, two experiments are conducted, the first informing the second by providing a baseline of performance.

The photon dose rate after shutdown from the resultant radionuclides must be quantified for maintenance planning. This shutdown dose rate (SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for this purpose. This requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work one such formulation is introduced which is valid when a specific set of transmutation criteria are met, referred to as the Single Neutron Interaction and Low Burnup (SNILB) criteria. These criteria are quantitatively evaluated for typical FES scenarios and are shown to be met within a reasonable margin. Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS, proposed here, is an implementation of MS-CADIS that calculates this adjoint neutron source using a series of irradiation calculations. For a simple SDR problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 90,000 ± 50,000 relative to analog. When the SNILB criteria are egregiously violated, GT-CADIS modifications are proposed and are shown to provide significant performance improvements. Finally, GT-CADIS is applied to a production-level problem involving a Spherical Tokamak Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (ST-FNSF) device.

            "abstractNote": "In fusion energy systems (FES) neutrons are born from a burning plasma and subsequently activate surrounding system components. The photon dose rate after shutdown from the resultant radionuclides must be quantified for maintenance planning. This shutdown dose rate (SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for this purpose. This requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work one such formulation is introduced which is valid when a specific set of transmutation criteria are met, referred to as the Single Neutron Interaction and Low Burnup (SNILB) criteria. These criteria are quantitatively evaluated for typical FES scenarios and are shown to be met within a reasonable margin. Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS, proposed here, is an implementation of MS-CADIS that calculates this adjoint neutron source using a series of irradiation calculations. For a simple SDR problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 90,000 ± 50,000 relative to analog. When the SNILB criteria are egregiously violated, GT-CADIS modifications are proposed and are shown to provide significant performance improvements. Finally, GT-CADIS is applied to a production-level problem involving a Spherical Tokamak Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (ST-FNSF) device. This work shows that GT-CADIS is broadly applicable to FES scenarios and will significantly reduce the computational resources necessary for SDR analysis.",

Since conventional methods produce a piecewise constant approximation, their accuracy can suffer when using coarse meshes to approximate neutron flux distributions with strong gradients.  Comparatively, KDE mesh tallies produce point estimates independently of the mesh structure, which means that their values will not change even if the mesh is refined.\n\nA new KDE integral-track estimator is introduced in this dissertation for use with mesh tallies.  Two input parameters are needed, namely a bandwidth and kernel.  The bandwidth is equivalent to choosing mesh cell size, whereas the kernel determines the weight of each contribution with respect to its distance from the calculation point being evaluated.  The KDE integral-track estimator is shown to produce more accurate results than the original KDE track length estimator, with no performance penalty, and identical or comparable results to conventional methods.  However, unlike conventional methods, KDE mesh tallies can use different bandwidths and kernels to improve accuracy without changing the input mesh.\n\nThis dissertation also explores the accuracy and efficiency of the KDE integral-track mesh tally in detail.

This choice becomes even more important when approximating regions of the neutron flux distribution with high curvature, where changing the bandwidth is much more sensitive.

Each method can be used individually, with the multigroup Krylov solver and multigrid-in-energy pre-conditioner being particularly successful on their own. For “grand challenge” eigenvalue problems, though, the largest benefit comes from using these methods in concert.",

The current study develops analysis capability for the U.S. reference design by extending existing LWR analysis codes and study SCWR behaviors under steady state, burnup and transient conditions.\n\nAn extended version of PARCS that can analyze SCWR in steady state is developed first. The modified code is used to demonstrate the importance of moderator heating on the neutronics behavior of U.S. SCWR design by simulating an infinite lattice of assemblies. The results show that the moderator heating leads to a more symmetric effective moderator density, and has a significant impact on the axial power shape. From this, sensitivity calculations are performed to show how the assembly performs with\nperturbations in assembly power, mass flow rate, bypass ratio and heat transfer coefficient.\n\nIn order to study transient and flow distribution between assemblies in SCWR, a coupled PARCS/RELAP5 code package specialized for current SCWR design is developed in this study. The variable mapping input file and related subroutines in PARCS are modified to transfer the physical properties of coolant and moderator separately between the coupled codes, and necessary code modification is also done in\nPARCS to automatically perform neutronics feedback based on not only fuel and coolant but also moderator physical properties. A finer data grid in the RELAP5 water table is adopted above the supercritical point to enable the thermal-hydrodynamics simulation in this range. A whole SCWR core model for the coupled PARCS/RELAP5 is established for this study and used in the rest of the study.\n\nFlow reversal in downward flowing moderator channels is discovered in steady state. It is due to the positive flow rate feedback to flow density change necessary for pressure balance. Choosing different orifice sizes based on corresponding assembly powers can prevent the reversal. The comparison of results from the coupled simulations with/without flow reversal shows that the reversed moderator flow introduces a large axial power peak at the bottom of the core and reduces the core reactivity. \n\nA burnup calculation shows that under the current design parameters the reactor cannot sustain criticality for one year, therefore further investigation on burnup is needed. A possible moderator reversal is found during the burnup calculation suggesting that the change in core axial power distribution during burnup should be considered while designing the various orifice sizes to prevent the reversal.\n\nA SCWR system model is developed which adds balance of the plant to the core model. Three transients are studied: loss of feedwater, loss of off-site power and loss of turbine load without scram. The results show that the maximum cladding surface temperatures satisfy the material limit. The location of maximum cladding surface temperature is not in the maximum power assembly. This suggests the normal hot channel analysis method may not applicable to SCWR.\n\nFuture work on sub-channel analysis, achieving full cycle burnup and more safety analyses is proposed.},\n\tlanguage = {English},\n\tschool = {University of Wisconsin-Madison},\n\tauthor = {Hu, Po},\n\tyear = {2008},\n}\n",

The comparison of results from the coupled simulations with/without flow reversal shows that the reversed moderator flow introduces a large axial power peak at the bottom of the core and reduces the core reactivity. \n\nA burnup calculation shows that under the current design parameters the reactor cannot sustain criticality for one year, therefore further investigation on burnup is needed. A possible moderator reversal is found during the burnup calculation suggesting that the change in core axial power distribution during burnup should be considered while designing the various orifice sizes to prevent the reversal.\n\nA SCWR system model is developed which adds balance of the plant to the core model. Three transients are studied: loss of feedwater, loss of off-site power and loss of turbine load without scram. The results show that the maximum cladding surface temperatures satisfy the material limit. The location of maximum cladding surface temperature is not in the maximum power assembly. This suggests the normal hot channel analysis method may not applicable to SCWR.\n\nFuture work on sub-channel analysis, achieving full cycle burnup and more safety analyses is proposed.",

For Rankine power cycles, one of the issues affecting\n corrosion is the radiolysis rate of water, which invariably alters water chemistry and thus\n affects corrosion rates. A fundamental experiment has been designed for water radiolysis at\n the UW nuclear reactor. The purpose of this experiment was to measure the neutron\n radiolysis rates of water at supercritical temperatures and pressures. The UWNR\n Supercritical Radiolysis Experiment is located at the University of Wisconsin Nuclear\n Reactor (UWNR) in the Mechanical Engineering Building in Madison, Wisconsin. The\n UWNR has four beam-ports that extend from the outside of the concrete reactor shield and\n structure to near the periphery of the core and the experiment uses beam-port \\#2.\n\nThe experimental facility was to be able to vary in pressure from 10MPa to 35MPA\n and in temperature from 30oC to 500oC. Water purified to a resistance of 18 MΩ and purged\n with nitrogen or various other gases was pumped up to pressure at the desired flow-rate and\n then through the experimental apparatus. A length of HASTELLOY® tubing wrapped around a cartridge heater first heated the sample water. Then a joule-heated section of the\n tubing heated the sample water so that it would be at the desired temperature when it entered\n the irradiation volume subject to the neutron flux. The tubing in the irradiation volume was\n also joule heated in order to minimize the temperature difference between the entrance and\n exit of the irradiation volume. The sample water was then cooled down in the water\n radiation shield to about 30oC and exited the apparatus. Its pressure was then reduced to\n ambient pressure in a length of capillary tubing submerged in a cooling bath.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to describe the thermal-hydraulic analysis that is\n associated with this radiolysis experiment. The interior of the apparatus was at a partial\n vacuum to minimize convective heat transfer, however heat transfer from conduction and\n radiation were still significant due to the increased temperatures and slow movement of the\n sample fluid. In the irradiation section, joule heating minimized the temperature difference\n from entrance to exit of the water sample. From data recorded during experiments, one could\n calculate a heat transfer coefficient and a view factor for the irradiation section to the\n apparatus. In the cartridge heater section, the heat transfer coefficient was calculated and\n compared to the Dittus-Boelter heat-transfer coefficient correlation. Challenges encountered\n in operation of this device included the stability of the temperature in the irradiation volume\n as well as heat loss due to radiation and conduction.\n\nSeveral aspects of the apparatus proved difficult to control. The lead and graphite\n shields took a long time to reach a steady state temperature.

            "abstractNote": "Operating near and above the thermodynamic supercritical point of water promises to\n improve economics but temperature-related corrosion issues present a challenge for proposed\n future nuclear reactor concepts. For Rankine power cycles, one of the issues affecting\n corrosion is the radiolysis rate of water, which invariably alters water chemistry and thus\n affects corrosion rates. A fundamental experiment has been designed for water radiolysis at\n the UW nuclear reactor. The purpose of this experiment was to measure the neutron\n radiolysis rates of water at supercritical temperatures and pressures. The UWNR\n Supercritical Radiolysis Experiment is located at the University of Wisconsin Nuclear\n Reactor (UWNR) in the Mechanical Engineering Building in Madison, Wisconsin. The\n UWNR has four beam-ports that extend from the outside of the concrete reactor shield and\n structure to near the periphery of the core and the experiment uses beam-port #2.\n\nThe experimental facility was to be able to vary in pressure from 10MPa to 35MPA\n and in temperature from 30oC to 500oC. Water purified to a resistance of 18 MΩ and purged\n with nitrogen or various other gases was pumped up to pressure at the desired flow-rate and\n then through the experimental apparatus. A length of HASTELLOY® tubing wrapped around a cartridge heater first heated the sample water. Then a joule-heated section of the\n tubing heated the sample water so that it would be at the desired temperature when it entered\n the irradiation volume subject to the neutron flux. The tubing in the irradiation volume was\n also joule heated in order to minimize the temperature difference between the entrance and\n exit of the irradiation volume. The sample water was then cooled down in the water\n radiation shield to about 30oC and exited the apparatus. Its pressure was then reduced to\n ambient pressure in a length of capillary tubing submerged in a cooling bath.\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to describe the thermal-hydraulic analysis that is\n associated with this radiolysis experiment. The interior of the apparatus was at a partial\n vacuum to minimize convective heat transfer, however heat transfer from conduction and\n radiation were still significant due to the increased temperatures and slow movement of the\n sample fluid. In the irradiation section, joule heating minimized the temperature difference\n from entrance to exit of the water sample. From data recorded during experiments, one could\n calculate a heat transfer coefficient and a view factor for the irradiation section to the\n apparatus. In the cartridge heater section, the heat transfer coefficient was calculated and\n compared to the Dittus-Boelter heat-transfer coefficient correlation. Challenges encountered\n in operation of this device included the stability of the temperature in the irradiation volume\n as well as heat loss due to radiation and conduction.\n\nSeveral aspects of the apparatus proved difficult to control. The lead and graphite\n shields took a long time to reach a steady state temperature. In addition, since the sample\n water came in through the same water shield that it exited and dumped its remaining heat\n into, the sample water would gradually increase in temperature before reaching the cartridge\n heater over the length of an experimental run. The temperature, raised and lowered many\n times during an experiment, would never attain complete equilibrium. It was common to see\n temperature variations of about a degree occur over about a half hour to an hour, which was\n deemed acceptable for the testing when taking the residence time of the water sample into\n account.",
