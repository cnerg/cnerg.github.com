Energy is then deposited along the path of the neutrons due to interactions with nuclides, resulting in - besides nuclear heating - two main effects; radiation damage and transmutation. Radiation damage causes changes in the macroscopic properties of the materials due to microscopic changes that result from interactions of high energy neutrons with nuclides. Transmutation is caused by the absorption of neutrons by nuclides in the medium and almost always results in the production of radioactive nuclides. Such radioactive nuclides are of importance to FES design and operation as they persist after the shutdown of the facility due to their long half lives. Efforts are directed to quantify the shutdown dose rate (SDR) that results from gamma emitting nuclides produced by transmutation. Monte Carlo (MC) methods are favored over deterministic methods for the simulation of particles transport in FES due to complexity of the models and to reduce the uncertainties/errors of the predicted particle flux distributions due to approximations. The rigorous 2-step method (R2S) relies on dedicated activation calculations to predict the photon emission density distribution, and is widely used for SDR quantification. It involves a neutron transport step, activation analysis to obtain the photon emission density, and a photon transport step to calculate the SDR.\nIt is often the case that neutrons suffer attenuation in traversing the medium from the plasma source - due to interactions with nuclides - and that results in a steep gradient in the neutron flux. Variance reduction (VR) tools have been developed with the primary goal of pushing neutrons - simulated particles - to regions of the phase-space that are of importance for the quantities under consideration in order to reduce the uncertainty in the MC results. The recently developed Group- wise Transmutation - Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (GT CADIS) method provides a capability to obtain the photon emission density distribution as a function of the energy dependent group-wise neutron flux distribution via linearization of the transmutation operator. Using the photon emission density it is possible to overcome previous difficulties of the error propagation in the R2S workflow. One primary concern with the R2S workflow is that only the contribution of the photon transport step is considered as a measure of the uncertainty of the calculated SDR, while the contribution from the neutron transport step remains undefined. Previous methods have tried to tackle this issue but there was always difficulty in obtaining the correlation of the neutron fluxes and that resulted in implementing either impractical approximations or just calculating the upper and lower bounds of the uncertainty of the SDR.\nIn this document, the R2S workflow has been investigated. First, issues related to the neutron transport step and the uncertainty of the photon emission density have been addressed. Second, a scheme was developed to propagate the statistical uncertainty of the neutron transport step to the SDR. Starting with the neutron transport step, a variation of the main R2S that aimed at increasing the resolution while reducing the computational expenses was found to introduce systematic errors that might undermine the gain in the computational cost. One of the difficulties in propagating the neutron flux uncertainty to the photon emission density is obtaining the correlation values between the neutron fluxes in different energy groups and mesh voxels. By utilizing the GT method, an approximation to the calculation of the correlation coefficients has been investigated building on the fact that using group-wise transmutation the correlation terms needed were greatly reduced. It was discovered that the correlation between the neutron fluxes in different energy groups is a function of the material composition. That facilitated obtaining the needed correlation matrix and quantifying the uncertainty of the photon emission density. A method to propagate the photon source uncertainty to the SDR by random sampling was developed and was demonstrated to be efficient on various types of numerical experiments as well as a production level problem.},\n\tlanguage = {English},\n\tschool = {University of Wisconsin-Madison},\n\tauthor = {Harb, Moataz S.},\n\tmonth = mar,\n\tyear = {2019},\n\tkeywords = {Correlation, Error Propagation, FESS-FNSF, R2S, SDR},\n}\n",

Variance reduction (VR) tools have been developed with the primary goal of pushing neutrons - simulated particles - to regions of the phase-space that are of importance for the quantities under consideration in order to reduce the uncertainty in the MC results. The recently developed Group- wise Transmutation - Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (GT CADIS) method provides a capability to obtain the photon emission density distribution as a function of the energy dependent group-wise neutron flux distribution via linearization of the transmutation operator. Using the photon emission density it is possible to overcome previous difficulties of the error propagation in the R2S workflow. One primary concern with the R2S workflow is that only the contribution of the photon transport step is considered as a measure of the uncertainty of the calculated SDR, while the contribution from the neutron transport step remains undefined. Previous methods have tried to tackle this issue but there was always difficulty in obtaining the correlation of the neutron fluxes and that resulted in implementing either impractical approximations or just calculating the upper and lower bounds of the uncertainty of the SDR.\nIn this document, the R2S workflow has been investigated. First, issues related to the neutron transport step and the uncertainty of the photon emission density have been addressed. Second, a scheme was developed to propagate the statistical uncertainty of the neutron transport step to the SDR. Starting with the neutron transport step, a variation of the main R2S that aimed at increasing the resolution while reducing the computational expenses was found to introduce systematic errors that might undermine the gain in the computational cost. One of the difficulties in propagating the neutron flux uncertainty to the photon emission density is obtaining the correlation values between the neutron fluxes in different energy groups and mesh voxels. By utilizing the GT method, an approximation to the calculation of the correlation coefficients has been investigated building on the fact that using group-wise transmutation the correlation terms needed were greatly reduced. It was discovered that the correlation between the neutron fluxes in different energy groups is a function of the material composition. That facilitated obtaining the needed correlation matrix and quantifying the uncertainty of the photon emission density. A method to propagate the photon source uncertainty to the SDR by random sampling was developed and was demonstrated to be efficient on various types of numerical experiments as well as a production level problem.",

This work\n culminated in several source sampling techniques being implemented within a 3-D neutron\n activation workflow.\n\nThe most significant development is the implementation of an efficient voxel sampling\n technique. Voxel sampling can be applied to source meshes with any number of mesh\n elements thanks to efficient sampling via the alias method, and meshing of non-source volumes\n can be avoided. Voxel sampling in turn enables straight-forward implementation of source\n biasing for variance reduction, and also the use of unstructured source meshes using\n tetrahedral mesh elements. The uniform sampling technique used in past work is effectively a\n biasing scheme, and thus can be implemented more efficiently with biased voxel sampling.\n\nFor this work, the source meshes are inherited from neutron mesh tallies. Cartesian\n structured meshes, which provide straight-forward compatibility with legacy tools can be\n sampled with either the voxel or uniform sampling methods. Alternately, using an unstructured\n mesh (via the unstructured mesh tally capabilities in DAG-MCNP) allows for better conforming\n meshes – particularly with geometries that do not align well with a structured mesh, or where\n the source region is spread out through a region of non-source materials, such as systems of\n pipes.\n\nThe set of source sampling techniques is useful as a toolkit for obtaining quality answers\n from a variety of scenarios. This thesis supplements methods development and\n implementation with experiments to identify and understand which sampling techniques\n should be used in different scenarios. The new sampling methods and workflows are shown to\n be in good agreement with results from older methods. While there remain several aspects of\n the new methods’ behavior to characterize, voxel sampling and its derivatives have fully\n replaced older sampling methods in neutron activation analysis work at UW-Madison.},\n\tlanguage = {English},\n\tschool = {University of Wisconsin-Madison},\n\tauthor = {Relson, Eric},\n\tmonth = jul,\n\tyear = {2013},\n}\n",

            "abstractNote": "This research focuses on developing mesh-based techniques for sampling distributed,\n volumetric sources in Monte Carlo particle transport codes, such as MCNP. This work\n culminated in several source sampling techniques being implemented within a 3-D neutron\n activation workflow.\n\nThe most significant development is the implementation of an efficient voxel sampling\n technique. Voxel sampling can be applied to source meshes with any number of mesh\n elements thanks to efficient sampling via the alias method, and meshing of non-source volumes\n can be avoided. Voxel sampling in turn enables straight-forward implementation of source\n biasing for variance reduction, and also the use of unstructured source meshes using\n tetrahedral mesh elements. The uniform sampling technique used in past work is effectively a\n biasing scheme, and thus can be implemented more efficiently with biased voxel sampling.\n\nFor this work, the source meshes are inherited from neutron mesh tallies. Cartesian\n structured meshes, which provide straight-forward compatibility with legacy tools can be\n sampled with either the voxel or uniform sampling methods. Alternately, using an unstructured\n mesh (via the unstructured mesh tally capabilities in DAG-MCNP) allows for better conforming\n meshes – particularly with geometries that do not align well with a structured mesh, or where\n the source region is spread out through a region of non-source materials, such as systems of\n pipes.\n\nThe set of source sampling techniques is useful as a toolkit for obtaining quality answers\n from a variety of scenarios. This thesis supplements methods development and\n implementation with experiments to identify and understand which sampling techniques\n should be used in different scenarios. The new sampling methods and workflows are shown to\n be in good agreement with results from older methods. While there remain several aspects of\n the new methods’ behavior to characterize, voxel sampling and its derivatives have fully\n replaced older sampling methods in neutron activation analysis work at UW-Madison.",

These adjoint-weighted tallies allow for the calculation of certain quantities important to understanding the physics of a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe methods, unlike traditional approaches to computing adjoint-weighted quantities, do not attempt to invert the random walk. Rather, they are based upon the iterated fission probability interpretation of the adjoint flux, which is the steady state population in a critical nuclear reactor caused by a neutron introduced at that point in phase space. This can be calculated in a strictly forward calculation, and this factor can be applied to previously computed tally scores.\n\nThese methods are implemented in a production Monte Carlo code and are used to calculate parameters requiring adjoint weighting, the point reactor kinetics parameters and reactivity changes based upon first-order perturbation theory.

These adjoint-weighted tallies allow for the calculation of certain quantities important to understanding the physics of a nuclear reactor.\n\nThe methods, unlike traditional approaches to computing adjoint-weighted quantities, do not attempt to invert the random walk. Rather, they are based upon the iterated fission probability interpretation of the adjoint flux, which is the steady state population in a critical nuclear reactor caused by a neutron introduced at that point in phase space. This can be calculated in a strictly forward calculation, and this factor can be applied to previously computed tally scores.\n\nThese methods are implemented in a production Monte Carlo code and are used to calculate parameters requiring adjoint weighting, the point reactor kinetics parameters and reactivity changes based upon first-order perturbation theory. The results of these calculations are compared against experimental measurements, equivalent discrete ordinates calculations, or other Monte Carlo based techniques.",
