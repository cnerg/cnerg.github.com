# This workflow is used to update the Zotero information that populates the
# publication lists on the website.
#
# When: this workflow is run when ever a commit is pushed to the `main` or
#       `test_actions` branches
#
# What: This workflow uses wget to fetch data from  Zotero and store it in a format
#       that will be used automatically by Jekyll when processing pages
#
# Requirements: For this action to work, there must be a secret key that
#               authorizes access to the Zotero data through its API.
#               You can learn more about such OAuth keys here: 
#               https://www.zotero.org/settings/keys/new
#               This key should be stored as `secrets.ZOTERO_GH_TOKEN`
